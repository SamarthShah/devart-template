## Description
In India , Diwali is one of the widely celebrated festivals. Everyyear people put Rangolis outside of their home. People are still using same old paper design to do Rangoli and still they have same problem of choosing different color for different sections. After speding so much time , if color combination does not seem proper, rework from scratch is required. We have seen digital transformation and have seen internet revolution but nothing has happened in this space. This project intends to transform that Rangoli making art into digital. Once you have Rangoli design ready , use this project(it will be Android Application) to scan the rangoli whihc will transform your rangoli to digital rangoli where you can try out different color combination and when satisfied, implement that in actual/physical rangoli. As of now this project is intended to use OpenCV for Android Library.
